# Mongoal using Vue

This was my first 5 hours using Vue.  
A monthly goal tracking web application that shows you statistics on how you're progressing through the month. Made using HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, Jquery, and Bootstrap. 

## Deployed

I tried to deploy it to gihub pages but I didnt have enough time to do that correctly :(
